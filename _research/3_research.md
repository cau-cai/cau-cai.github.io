To develop efficient AI, rigorous evaluation is essential. If the evaluation is incorrect, the efficiency of the AI model may be inaccurately assessed, which can impede its real-world deployment. If trained models are well equipped with visual intelligence, they should be robust against small deviations of input images from the trained domain that can occur naturally (e.g., successive image compression) or intentionally (e.g., adversarial attacks). However, when we focus exclusively on enhancing model efficiency, we may overlook critical aspects like robustness. Therefore, we have investigated the vulnerabilites of trained models and developed more robust models {% cite choi2019evaluating choi2020adversarially choi2022deep hwang2021just kim2020instability kim2022successive %}. We have also explored fair evaluation methods for generated images {% cite choi2020srzoo lee2023demystifying %}.
